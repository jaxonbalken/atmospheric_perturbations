# Atmospheric Perturbations
This is code to simulate the atmosphereic perturbations. The data used is from videos of Polaris.
# Info on Camera 
They are all done using the ZWO290mm mini camera with 2.9 micron pixels, at the focus of our 750mm focal length subelement optics. Measurments on an average clear night from SB (so not very good 'seeing').
# Uses
This repo will have the tools to centroid the images taken, and calcualte the statistics of the motion on the focal plane. 
The output of the data found will be an analog on a very distant beacon.
